This document contains further instructions to build international 
(French & German) versions of LS-DOS 6.3.1 using the original package
from Tim Mann and Pete Cervasio.


Needed are all stuff required to build the American version of LS-DOS
6.3.1 plus the source file KIDVRFG.ASM containing the keyboard mappings
for French (azerty) and German (quertz) keyboards. This file can be
obtained from "LS-DOS 6.3.1 Source Code Restoration Project", thanks
Frank Durda IV.
(http://nemesis.lonestar.org/computers/tandy/software/os/logical_systems/lsdos6/src631/index.html).


You will need to import KIDVRFG.ASM into drive :2 using the following
command from a DOS prompt:

IMPORT -N KIDVRFG.ASM KIDVRFG/ASM:2


Then the LOWCORE/ASM file needs to be modified to include the new
driver source KIDVRFG/ASM; include the following lines just after the
two lines "GERM    EQU     nn" (lines 187 and 191):

*GET    KIDVRFG


Now, you can activate the German or French by changing line 23 or 24
(not both) to:

@GERMAN EQU     -1
@FRENCH EQU     -1


That's it.  Enjoy !
